### Cloud Computing

Cloud computing delivers computing resources such as: storage, processing power, and software applications. It does this over the internet on a pay-as-you-go, on demand basis.

Users can therefore access computing resources and utilise them remotely instead of being limited locally on individual computers. 


**History of Cloud Computing**
- In 50-60s, the idea around many users being able to access a single mainframe computer at the same time emerged
- 70-80s - Advances in virtualisation with many VMs being able to run on 1 machine, creating a baseline for sharing resources and scalability
- 90-2000s - Saw more internet based services. Web host providers were able to offer storage and virtual servers over the web. Salesforce.com came in 1999, started the idea of providing enterprise applications through a web browser.
- Mid-2000s - AWS launched in 2006. This gives on demand computing resources, storage and infrastructure services that are scalable. Marked the start of modern cloud computing.
- 2008-2010 - Google App Engine allowed devs to make and deploy web applications in the cloud. Microsoft also made Azure in 2010 which provides a suite of cloud services.

Currently, many providers offer the followinf solutions:
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)




### Benefits of cloud computing

- Scale resources
- Reduce costs
- Increase flexibility
- Access many applications and services without needing major infrastrucure investments


###  Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS  is Amazon's cloud computing platform. It offers cloud services like: Computing power, storage, databases, analytics, networking, machne learning, and more. This allows for scalability and flexible cloud resources. 

2006 - AWS was launched to provide on demand acces to computing resources using the internet

Early stages - Initially focused on providing IaaS e.g., Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for virtual servers and Simple Storage Service (S3) for scalable storage.

Expansion stages - AWS added more services like databases (RDS, DynamoDB), networking (VPC), CloudFront, serverless computing (Lambda), AI services...

It started to attract attention in the market due to it's infrastructure being very robus, It also offered serveral services and a cost effective pay-as-you-go model

It has AWS regions. These refer to their global network of data centers found in different geographical locations. The AWS regions have availablility zones which provide extensions, helping to reduce latency and fault tolerance.  




### Who are the other main cloud providers
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform
- IBM Cloud
- Oracle Clod Infrastructure 
- Alibaba Cloud

### What is IaaS, PaaS and SaaS - make a diagram

**IaaS** - Infrastructure as a Service is a cloud computing model where the cloud service provider offers virtualized computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking, to users. Users have control over the operating systems, applications, and configurations running on the infrastructure.

**PaaS** - Platform as a Service is a cloud model where the cloud service provider offers a platform that includes the infrastructure and tools need to make, deploy, and manage applications. Users focus on developing and managing their applications, while the underlying infrastructure is abstracted away.

**SaaS** - Software as a Service is a model where the cloud service provider delivers software applications over the internet. Users access and use these applications through a web browser or API without the needing local installation or management. The provider handles the infrastructure, maintenance, and updates of the software.

### Differences between public, hybrid, and private clouds 

## Public Cloud

- cloud services that are available to the general public over the internet

- Resources are shared among multiple organizations or users

- offers scalability, cost-efficiency, and eliminates the need for on-premises infrastructure management


Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform.

Start ups and small businesses, SaaS providers, and web and monile apps may use this cloud type.


## Private Cloud

- cloud infrastructure for only a single organisation.

- Resources are not shared with providing greater control, security, and privacy

- More customisation options but may need higher initial investment and maintenance costs.

Examples: On-premises data centers and privately hosted cloud environments.

Businesses with data privacy concerns, regulatory compliance requirements e.g. banking services, and large corporations who want full control, may use this cloud type.


## Hybrid Cloud 

- A combination of public and private cloud environments, allowing seamless integration and data sharing between them.

- Organisations can leverage both on-premises infrastructure and public cloud services to meet needs.

- provides flexibility, scalability. You can use public cloud resources for non-sensitive data, while keeping sensitive data in a private cloud.

- Gives a balance between control, security, and cost-efficiency. 

- Needs integration and management of both environments, and data transfer between them may involve security considerations.

Examples: Combining on-premises infrastructure with public cloud services for specific workloads or applications.

Businesses that have varied workloads/ seasonal demands, data-intensive applications, and want to expand their coloud infrastructure and be able to use multiple cloud providers to choose the more suitable services for different needs, may use this cloud type. 


### Operating Expenditure (OpEx)

This is the ongoing expenses that a business has for it's day-to-day operations.

It is the costs needed to keep businesses going and make revenue.

This is the best option for businesses due to it's pay-as-you-go aspect; If you no longer need something, you can turn it off and save the business costs. 

Examples of OpEx include:
- Employee salaries and benefits 
- Rent 
- Marketting and advertising 
- Equipment 


### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

CapEx is the flat funds that a business invests in acquiring, upgrading, or maintaining long-term assets or capital assets. Capital expenditures are typically made with the intention of generating benefits and value over an extended period.

On premises, this will include any hardware/ infrastructure


###  How the clouds enable businesses to transfer to spending more on OpEx

1. **Elimination of Upfront Costs**: In the cloud, businesses can leverage infrastructure provided by cloud service providers, eliminating the need for large initial CapEx outlays.

2. **Scalability** and **Flexibility**: Cloud services allow businesses to scale their resources up or down based on demand. Instead of investing in overprovisioned infrastructure to accommodate peak loads, businesses can dynamically allocate and pay for the resources they need, aligning expenses with actual usage.

3. **Subscription-Based Pricing**: Cloud providers often offer subscription-based pricing models, where businesses pay for cloud services on a monthly or usage-based basis. This OpEx approach allows businesses to convert their infrastructure costs into ongoing operational expenses, simplifying budgeting and financial planning.

4. **Maintenance and Support**:  This relieves businesses from the burden of maintaining and upgrading their own infrastructure, reducing associated CapEx costs.

5. **Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**. Buisnesses They can avoid the costs of purchasing, maintaining, and replacing hardware and software, as well as expenses related to power, cooling, physical space, and IT personnel required for on-premises infrastructure.

6. **Resource Optimisation**: Cloud services enable businesses to optimize their resource utilization, scaling resources up during peak periods and down during low-demand periods. This flexibility helps minimize idle capacity and reduce wasted costs, maximizing the efficiency of IT investments.

7. **Access to Advanced Technologies**: By leveraging the cloud, businesses can access cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, and IoT without the need for upfront CapEx investment


### Cases of companies that have transfered to the cloud

1) **Netflix** - can scale it's infrastructure to handle big increases in streaming demand e.g., during popular show releases. 

Netflix uses AWS and its cloud infrastructure allows Netflix to provide it's contents globally.
